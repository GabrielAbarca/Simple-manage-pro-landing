 *  Only one process can hold :4321. A second `npm run preview` silently moves
 *  to :4322 and every harness then measures the STALE build, which reads as
 *  "my change did nothing" and has cost a session before. When something else
 *  already has the port — a dev server someone left running — start preview
 *  elsewhere and point the harnesses at it rather than guessing:
 *
 *      npx astro preview --port 4325
 *      PREVIEW_URL=http://localhost:4325 npm run audit:contrast
